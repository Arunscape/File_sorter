# File Sorter

A python script to sort files in a messy folder, such as your Downloads or Desktop folders.
###### Written for Windows and Linux

## Usage Instructions

1. On the first run, the script will ask you if you want to monitor your Downloads folder. If you enter 'n' or 'no' then, it will ask
you which folder you want to monitor.
2. The script will edit the 'settings.csv' file for you with some default settings:
  * Example of default behavior: If you chose to monitor the 'Downloads' folder, then your pictures will show up in a folder
    located in Downloads/Pictures
   If you would like to change where files are moved to, edit the 'settings.csv' file before the program prompts you to 'Press Enter to Continue" If you're on Windows, edit the column for Windows, and for Linux, edit the column for Linux. Ignore the column for the OS that you're not using
   The leftmost column is the file extension, and the column on the right dictates where the files of that extension in the folder you chose to monitor will go to.
   
3. Enjoy
